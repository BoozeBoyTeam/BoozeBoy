# BoozeBoy: Smart Speed Rail

# Abstract
Many bars and restaurants take inventory of their supplies after a set time period, sometimes weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, and some even once every couple of months. At the most basic procedure, this process involves counting the inventory at the beginning of a predetermined time period and then once again at the end of said time period. While this procedure may seem effective at first, it leaves a multi-billion dollar blind spot stemming from shrinkage. 

The problem with the basic approach is that while it keeps track of the input and the output, it fails to keep track of the details in between the input and the output inventory counts. Fortunately, this report explores a solution that seeks to provide insight into the inventory of such a business where it needs it the most: the service liquor bottle’s end-user life cycle. From the speed rail to the bartender to the shot glass to the customer and back to the speed rail. This is where the magic truly happens. The inbetween of the conventional time period: the input’s future and the output’s past. Introducing the solution of the present: a real-time monitoring system. The BoozeBoy: Smart Speed Rail.

The BoozeBoy: Smart Speed Rail is an IoT connected inventory system that monitors the real-time changes in the wide array of bottles commonly found at bars and restaurants and provides easy-to-understand user-friendly data visualization based on the monitored changes within each individual bottle. Our design monitors the changes in the liquor bottles found inside our custom speed rail via an embedded system that uses force sensors to monitor the predetermined bottle locations. The monitored data is then published via Message Queue Telemetry Transport to a cloud IoT platform where the data is then analyzed, visualized, and displayed to the end-user, thus allowing the end-user to observe the real-time statistics of the speed rail bottle inventory wirelessly and effortlessly. Finally, allowing access to data that encourages action in the moment - when it really matters - as opposed to the future once it is no longer as relevant.
